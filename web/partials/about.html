                This project is meant to serve as a more feature-rich starting point for enterprise and commercial web
                applications. It integrates AngularJS with projects like Angular-UI, Angular-Strap, Bootstrap, and
                jQuery, along with examples of angular services, directives, controllers, and filters.

            <b>Project goals:</b>
        </p>

        <p>

        <ul>
            <li>Remain static, as in no web server _processing_ required. The only need for a web server is to host
                the contents of the app folder.
            </li>
            <li>Integrate best-of-breed JavaScript MVC, styling, ui, and tooling components "the Angular way"</li>
            <li>Provide examples of services, directives, controllers, and filters in a way that can be cherry
                picked for use elsewhere.
            </li>
            <li>See Authentication and REST service examples and fadein and stop-propagation directive examples.
            </li>
            <li>Provide example of ui widgets done the Angular way. See the Playground menu option in the top
                navbar. UI/widget examples include a paginated grid with sort and filter support, accordion, tree,
                tabs, and date/time pickers.
